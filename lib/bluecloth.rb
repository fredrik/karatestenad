# == To-do
#
# * Refactor some of the larger uglier methods that have to do their own
#   brute-force scanning because of lack of Perl features in Ruby's Regexp
#   class. Alternately, could add a dependency on 'pcre' and use most Perl
#   regexps.
#
# * Put the StringScanner in the render state for thread-safety.
